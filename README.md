# IPT5.0-CommissionsApp
This application was created as a school project to manage my commissions.

As a school project, this is not a fully functional application yet and it serves only
as a practical show of what I have learned in object based programming.


This Commission app is a programm that helps me manage my art commissions locally
on my computer.

I will be learning the use of WPF and MVVM with this project, additionally
to what I have already learned of C# and object based programming.

The Word File will be the only file in german as required by my school.
